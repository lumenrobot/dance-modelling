%% Input Signal
%
% * SYNC (uint32): IMAQ synchronization time in msec.

%% Output Signals
%
% * Tracking (int32): Number of people in skeleton tracking.
%
% * Skeleton (double): XYZ coordinates of skeleton joints.
% Either Real world or Projective coordinate can be configured.
%
% [OpenNI]
%
% Total 15 skeleton joints are tracked. If a XYZ joint data is [0 0 0], it means that the joint position could not be recognized.
% Index number of skeleton joints data represents
% Head = 1, Neck = 2, Torso = 3, Left shoulder = 4, Left elbow = 5,
% Left hand = 6, Right shoulder = 7, Right elbow = 8, Right hand= 9,
% Left hip = 10, Left knee = 11, Left foot = 12, Right hip = 13, Right knee = 14, Right foot = 15.
% Left and Right are mirrored (it's not tracking user's point of view, but viewpoint from NID).

% [Kinect SDK for Windows]
%
% Total 20 skeleton joints are tracked. If a XYZ joint data is [0 0 0], it means that the joint position could not be recognized.
% Index number of skeleton joints data represents
% Hip center = 1, Spine = 2, Shoulder center = 3, Head = 4, Shoulder left = 5,
% Elbow left = 6, Wrist left = 7, Hand left = 8, Shoulder right = 9, Elbow right = 10,
% Wrist right = 11, Hand right = 12, Hip left = 13, Knee left = 14, Ankle left = 15,
% Foot left = 16, Hip right = 17, Knee right = 18, Ankle right = 19, Foot right = 20.

% * Image (uint8): RGB24 image of skeleton.

%% Block Parameters
%
% * Max number of Skeleton Tracking: Maximum number of people in skeleton tracking. If 2 is configured, addtional
% Skeleton output will be added.
%
% * Real world coordinates (Default: Projective): Choose Real world (X, Y, Z in meter) or Projective (X, Y in pixel and Z in meter) coordinates for skeleton joints.
%
% Projective coodinates:

%
% * Image output: Return RGB24 image of skeleton.

%% Calibration for Skeleton tracking (for only OpenNI)
% Note that calibration for skeleton tracking is required for only Need PSI pose for calibration of Skeleton tracking in IMAQ block is checked or pose less
% calibration unsupported OpenNI was used.
%
% The skeleton tracking calibration requires the following steps:
%
% * Start simulation.
%
% * If a person moved in front of the device, person shape should be appeared in the display.
% 
% * The person needs to take a calibration pose called ÅgPSIÅh to start calibration.
%
% <<PsiPose.jpg>>
%
% * Once the calibration pose is recognized, the color of the motion detected shape should be turned to white and keep the calibration pose until skeleton tracking begins.
%
% * While skeleton tracking is performed, small crosses '+' are drawn at the skeleton joints position on the motion detected shape in the display of Image output.
